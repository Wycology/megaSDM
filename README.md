## Description

This package can efficiently create and project species distribution
models using the MaxEnt framework and parallel processing. It can find
and download occurrence data for a list of species on GBIF (Global
Biodiversity Information Facility), environmentally subsample the
occurrences to mitigate spatial bias, generate background
(pseudo-absence) points, train the model and project it to different
times (incorporating dispersal rate of each species and intermediate
range fluctuations), and create species richness maps for each time
period and taxon.

## Vignette

We have provided an example vignette
(brshipley/megaSDM/megaSDM\_vignette.html) using occurrence data from
GBIF for 6 North American mammal species. Environmental data are from
the WorldClim database (Hijmans et al.Â 2005;
<https://www.worldclim.org/>), and data on dispersal rate (in km/year)
were collected by HS. The html file (and acossiated R Markdown file
within the package) displays the entire functionality of megaSDM in a
cohesive workflow, from data collection to the analysis and presentation
of results.

## Installation

In R, use `devtools::install_github("brshipley/megaSDM", build_vignettes
= TRUE)` to install the package with the vignette (see above) included.
To access the vignette itself, run `vignette(package = "megaSDM")`, and
the vignette will be loaded.
